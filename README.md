# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub.  ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

You can now find me at [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~grego) instead. I will host here only the past projects and mirrors of repos where someone might find it convenient to contribute to
via GitHub, without encouraging to do so.

Join us; you can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too!
