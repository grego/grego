# Give Up GitHub

I have given up GitHub.  ([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

You can now find me at [sr.ht](https://git.sr.ht/~grego) instead. I will host here only the past projects and mirrors of repos where someone might find it convenient to contribute to
via GitHub, without encouraging to do so.

Any use of any of my project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without our permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of my projects' code in Copilot.

Join us; you can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too!
